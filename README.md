## What I learnt building this
I have started this project with pre-planed HTML structere but as I moved further in this project I came across multiple new feature ideas which is one of good challenge to make those idea working 
on already build page.
Learned about after changing the HTML dynamically how to call the other functions so the other realted features should work properly.
I learned why it is important to make a Blue Print of complete features and how they should act , it maked all the remaining word(code) easy to write.
